# Icons

Geometr comes with a [Material Design Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) library ready to go. To use the icons, you need to use a `span` element with the following structure:

```html
<span class="mdi mdi-close-thick" />
```

On this example, the `span` element will transform into the `close-thick` icon.
